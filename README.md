# Deep Domain Adaptation

## Usage
This is the implementation of paper Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation <br />
The implementation was based on Pytorch 0.4.0
The ipynb file can be run directly and the corresponding dataset will be downloaded
MNist to MNist-M, SYNNUM to SVHN, SVHN to MNIST and Office dataset have been successfully replicated
SYNSIGN to GTSRB, GAN and WGAN are still under experiment
