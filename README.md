# Deep Domain Adaptation

## Usage
This is the implementation of paper Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation
The implementation was based on Pytorch 0.4.0
The ipynb file can be run directly and the corresponding dataset will be downloaded
MNist to MNist-M, SYNNUM to SVHN, SVHN to MNIST and Office dataset have been successfully replicated
SYNSIGN to GTSRB, GAN and WGAN are still under experiment
